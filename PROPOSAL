My goal is to build a simple GPU that supports instructions to render to a
screen via the HDMI port. The ISA for the GPU will allow for matrix operations
so that common 2D and 3D transformations can be applied. Furthermore, there will
be instructions to allow you to render simple primitives, such as points and
triangles.
